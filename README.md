# GTK-Spreadsheet
C++ GTK program creates a window with a 10X11 grid of entries that acts analogous to a spreadsheet.

Creates a 10x11 grid of entries. Entering floating-point values updates that column's bottom-row entry to be the sum of the column. Text is treated as 0 for the sum. 

The save button overwrites the file "output.csv" in the same subdirectory as the executable. It saves the contents of all entries in the grid.
